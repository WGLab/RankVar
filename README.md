# RankVar
RankVar is an AI-driven pipeline that integrates phenotype data and sequencing profiles to prioritize disease-causing genes and variants.

# Installation
### Step 1: install sources
We recommend using Conda to set up the environment. If Conda is not installed, run the following commands in Linux to install it.

```bash
curl -O https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
```
After conda is installed successfully, RankVar sources can be downloaded:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/WGLab/RankVar.git
cd RankVar
```
